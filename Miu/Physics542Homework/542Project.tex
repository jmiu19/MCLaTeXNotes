\textit{Project Title}: \textbf{The Application of Floquet Theory in Quantum Optics}\\

\textit{Abstract}: When solving the two-level system problem, RWA is widely used, but the RWA is valid only when the Rabi frequency is much smaller than the transition frequency. When RWA cannot be used, a common treatment is to apply the Floquet theory, in which case the evolution of the system is expressed in a Fourier series in terms of the oscillation frequency. In this project, we will introduce the Floquet theory, the temporal analog of Bloch theory, and apply it to solve two-level system problems. Then we will have a closer look at the solutions by solving the system numerically. Lastly, we will look at the application of this approach in solving research-level problems, such as quantum optimal control and time crystals.\\
